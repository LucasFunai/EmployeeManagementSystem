# EmployeeManagementSystem
Contains all code from my training project, EMS.

You can make modifications for this code, and I suggest you do not use this code as-is, because it has some security flaws.

EMS is a simple work time card app. Workers press a button when they start working, and press it again when they leave.
The admin can then check the data from each worker, and even record a score for their work.

There are ranks, and anybody ranked higher than another worker can set the performance scores.
So an employee can be scored by their supervisor, that supervisor gets scored by theirs... and so on.

Made with Java, JavaFX, SQL, and handmade cryptography for the data.
